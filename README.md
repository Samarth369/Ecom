# 📊 E-Commerce Data Analysis

**Deep dive into sales, customer behavior, and regional insights using SQL and Python**

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **data analysis project** exploring patterns and business insights from an e-commerce dataset. Using **MySQL** for data extraction and **Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)** for analysis and visualization, this project demonstrates how raw order and customer data can be transformed into meaningful business intelligence.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

📁 **main.ipynb** – The core Jupyter Notebook containing:

- SQL data extraction and aggregation queries
- Exploratory analysis using Python
- Visualizations and key insight

---

## 🔍 Objectives

This project aims to:

1. **Combine multiple data sources** for analysis.
2. **Uncover business insights**, such as:
   - Top-performing product categories
   - Highest revenue regions/cities
   - Customer order patterns
3. **Visualize patterns** clearly for business interpretation.

## 📊 Key Findings

- **Top Cities & Regions:** Identified cities with the highest order counts and revenue potential.
- **Category Insights:** Certain product categories demonstrate greater sales performance.
- **Temporal Trends:** Order frequency and revenue patterns across time periods.
  
> These insights can help inform inventory allocation, marketing focus, and logistical decisions.

## 📈 How It Works

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Import raw CSV files into MySQL.
- Establish relationships between orders, products, customers, and locations.

### 2. **SQL Data Extraction**
- Write queries to aggregate order counts, revenue totals, and customer demographics.
- Export query results for further analysis.

### 3. **Python Analysis**
- Load SQL output into Pandas DataFrames.
- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
- Create visualizations to highlight key results.
